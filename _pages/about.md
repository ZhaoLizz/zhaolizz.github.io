I am currently working toward a Ph.D. degree at the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, within the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/) at Beihang University, by [Prof. Lili Wang](https://liliwang.net/). I've also been working closely with [Prof. Xuequan Lu](http://www.xuequanlu.com/).

Prior to that, I spent three wonderful research years and received the Master's degree in the College of Information Engineering at  Northwest A&F University by [Prof. Meili Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yNb6-d4AAAAJ) in 2023.

My research primarily focuses on 3D human avatar, neural rendering, and geometry modeling for virtual reality applications.
